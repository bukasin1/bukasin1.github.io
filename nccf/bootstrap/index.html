			In Nigeria, examinations are either internal or public. Internal examinations are the examinations set by teachers or lecturers in form of class tests and end of the term or semester examinations; public examinations on the other hand, are examinations that are conducted in the public interest by organized examining bodies that are not involved in preparing students for the examination (Addison, 2008; Salami, 2009 and Adeyemi 2009).  Examination malpractice in the Nigeria educational system most especially in Rivers State is widely discussed which a menace to where the country is. Examination malpractice is seen as any irregular behaviour or misconducts, surrounding examinations and it came to an alarming rate in the last three decades (WAEC 2007). The Nigeria society is that which celebrates mediocre and views cheats as being smart. The society does not want  to know how an individual achieve success; the important thing is the success. Just as the politicians employ rigging at elections and enjoy enviable political offices; so do students cheat from primary to tertiary institutions to move from one level to another. All sorts of misconducts take place in examination in order to succeed. According to Adesina (2007) and Bandele (2006), examination in Nigeria schools dated back to the advent of formal education in the country in the 1800s was patterned after the British system. The 1987 ordinance made provision for examinations in schools that have attained the requisite percentage of proficiency. Towards this end, all secondary schools in the country are to teach their subjects to meet the requirements of the examination bodies for the Senior Certificate Examination Council and National Examination Commission (FGN, 2006). Since the advent of Western education in Nigeria, examination has being the major instrument used for the evaluation of learnersâ€™ achievement. It is a means of assessing the quality and quantity or performance that an individual has accumulated at the end of a teaching process which spread over a period of seventeen weeks.</h1>

				The occurrence of examination malpractice at any level of educational stratum possess the greatest threat to the validity and reliability of any examination and consequently to the authenticity and recognition of certificate issued. The persistent occurrence of examination malpractice has been a major concern to educationist (Aghenta, 2010; Ige, 2013); it has also become a major challenge to examination bodies, the government of  Nigeria, school administrators and parents alike. The concept of promoting students from one class or academic level to another through examination has been one of the reasons behind examination malpractice with students devising various methods of examination malpractice just to succeed in their academic endeavours. Observations show that the causes of persistent occurrence of examination malpractice are pioneered by the people known as the agents of examination malpractice in the educational sector who contributed to the geometric growth of this unlawful act. Despite the high premium placed on examinations by National Policy on
